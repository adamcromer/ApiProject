Humaniteer is a site to find local volunteer oppurtunites near you or to host your own volunteer events to help recruit fellow volunteers and help make your community a better place.

This is a project made by Jeremy Atwood, Jeremy Cantwell, & Adam Cromer, with special help Braydon Harris.

Humaniteer was made using Javascript, JQuery, HTML, CSS, FullCalendar, Bootstrap, JQueryUI, Google Fonts, Google Firebase, and Google Maps.
